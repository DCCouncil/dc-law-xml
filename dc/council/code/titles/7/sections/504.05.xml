  <heading>Vacancies.</heading>
  <text>When a vacancy develops on the Commission, the Mayor with the advice and consent of the Council of the District of Columbia may appoint a successor to fill the unexpired portion of the term. A member may continue to serve beyond the expiration date of the member’s term until a successor is duly qualified. If within 30 calendar days of development of a vacancy on the Commission the Mayor fails to transmit to the Council of the District of Columbia a nomination for that vacancy, the Council of the District of Columbia may make the appointment. If within 60 calendar days of submission of a nomination for the Commission the Council of the District of Columbia fails to act, the nomination shall be deemed confirmed.</text>
